You can change range, brightness and color of the customizable light item by clicking it and holding various keys. It can built indoor or outdoor.<br>
You can change the size and orientation of the customizable picture frame item (also you can set its content image from the screenshot folder like any other regular picture frame).<br>

Giant cove trees that you plant below 100m and have eggs displayed will spawn ghost leviathans if you enable the option in mod config.<br>
The audio effects of the alien relics sometimes stay at their initial position so you need to save and restart Subnautica for the audio effects to take their new positions into account.<br>
All items can be rotated and placed in any base or cyclops.<br>
For an easier placement of items, you can temporarily enable the "Lock quickslots when placing item" feature in the options menu (in "Mods" tab).<br>
Note that if you place raw materials as decorations, stalkers will try to come and steal them (even if they are placed in a base).<br>
All new flora is compatible with bioreactors and fully configurable (growth duration, health points, nutrient points, etc).<br>
Both long planters can be built indoor or outdoor (tip: you can use this to have land plants in water or sea plants in bases/cyclops).<br>
To unlock every items instantly you can change "Discovery settings" in configuration, or use commands "unlockall" + "ency all".<br>
To grow plants instantly you can use command "day".<br>
